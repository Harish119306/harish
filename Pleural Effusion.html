    <div1><h1>what is pleural effusion?</h1><font color="blue" font size="5" align="center" font type="algeria">
    <p>A build-up of fluid between the tissues that line the lungs and the chest.
        Fluid can accumulate around the lungs due to poor pumping by the heart or by inflammation.
        Symptoms include coughing, sharp chest pain or shortness of breath.</p></font>

        <ul>
            <li>Treatment of pleural effusion is based on the underlying condition and whether the effusion is causing severe       
                 respiratory symptoms, such as shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</li>
            <li>Diuretics and other heart failure medications are used to treat pleural effusion caused by congestive heart failure or 
                 other medical causes. A malignant effusion may also require treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a 
                  medication infusion within the chest.</li>
            <li>A pleural effusion that is causing respiratory symptoms may be drained using therapeutic thoracentesis or through a 
                 chest tube (called tube thoracostomy).</li>
            <li>For patients with pleural effusions that are uncontrollable or recur due to a malignancy despite drainage, a sclerosing 
                 agent (a type of drug that deliberately induces scarring) occasionally may be instilled into the pleural cavity through 
                  a tube thoracostomy to create a fibrosis (excessive fibrous tissue) of the pleura (pleural sclerosis).</li>
            <li>Pleural sclerosis performed with sclerosing agents (such as talc, doxycycline, and tetracycline) is 50 percent 
                 successful in preventing the recurrence of pleural effusions.</li>
